# Design Decisions and Architecture

## Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity First**
   - Keep systems loosely coupled
   - Enable easy testing and modification
   - Allow for future expansion

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Keep core game loop efficient
   - Optimize for large maps and many units
   - Careful resource management

3. **AI Integration**
   - Clean separation between game state and AI systems
   - Asynchronous LLM processing
   - Fallback systems for offline play

## Open Decisions and Considerations

This document tracks major design decisions and their implications. Each entry includes options considered and final decisions.

### Current Decisions Needed

1. **Map System**
   - Options:
     a) Fixed grid (easier, traditional)
     b) Hex grid (more natural movement)
     c) Point-based (most flexible but complex)
   - Impact: Affects pathfinding, unit movement, and combat mechanics
   - Status: Awaiting decision

2. **State Management**
   - Options:
     a) Central state manager
     b) Event-driven system
     c) Hybrid approach
   - Impact: Affects game performance and code complexity
   - Status: Awaiting decision

3. **Scaling Approach**
   - Options:
     a) Fixed map size with dense gameplay
     b) Variable size with performance-based limits
     c) Chunked loading system
   - Impact: Affects game scope and technical architecture
   - Status: Awaiting decision

### Resolved Decisions

1. **Game Engine**
   - Decision: Godot
   - Rationale: Good 2D support, Python-like syntax, free and open source

### State Management

TBD - Awaiting decision on state management approach

### AI Integration Architecture

```
Game State → State Analyzer → LLM Request Queue → Response Processor → Event Generator
```

## Performance Targets

- Target minimum specs: TBD
- Maximum map size: TBD
- Maximum unit count: TBD
- Target frame rate: 60 FPS

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for core game logic
2. Integration tests for system interactions
3. Performance benchmarks
4. AI response quality metrics
