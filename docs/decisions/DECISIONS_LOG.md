# Technical Decisions Log

## How to Use This Log
- Each decision should have a clear problem statement and context
- All major options must be listed with pros/cons
- Final decision must be clearly stated with rationale
- Impact and implementation notes should be included
- Link to relevant GitHub discussions/issues if they exist

## Decisions

### DEC-001 - Map System Implementation
Date: 2025-01-20
Session: LLM_20250120_001

#### Context
Need to select a base map system for the 4X game that balances implementation complexity, gameplay depth, and performance. This is a fundamental decision that will affect many other systems.

#### Options Considered
1. **Fixed Square Grid**
   - Pros:
     - Simplest to implement
     - Familiar to players (like Civilization)
     - Easier pathfinding
     - Better performance
     - Simpler UI/UX (easy to click)
   - Cons:
     - Less natural movement (diagonal issues)
     - Can look less organic
     - Limited tactical depth

2. **Hex Grid**
   - Pros:
     - More natural movement
     - Better tactical options
     - Still relatively simple to implement
     - Common in modern 4X games
     - Good balance of complexity vs features
     - Better suited for storytelling (organic feel)
   - Cons:
     - Slightly more complex pathfinding
     - More complex UI considerations
     - Can be harder to render properly

3. **Point-based**
   - Pros:
     - Most flexible
     - Can create organic-looking maps
     - Better for certain types of storytelling
   - Cons:
     - Much more complex to implement
     - Harder to create good UI
     - Performance intensive
     - More complex save/load system

#### Decision
**Chosen Option**: Hex Grid

**Rationale**:
- Provides best balance of complexity vs features
- Better suited for storytelling with more organic feel
- Modern feel while still being familiar to players
- Reasonable complexity for a first project
- Good community resources available
- Better tactical gameplay without excessive complexity

#### Implementation
- Will need to implement custom hex grid system
- Consider using axial or cube coordinates for calculations
- May need to create custom pathfinding implementation
- Should create utility functions for hex math early

#### Impact
- Affects movement system design
- Influences UI layout and interaction
- Affects performance considerations for map size
- Will impact combat system design
- Influences resource and territory visualization

### DEC-002 - Development Coordination System
Date: 2025-01-20
Session: LLM_20250120_001

#### Context
Need a system to coordinate between multiple LLM instances and human developer, ensuring consistent development despite context limitations and potential parallel work.

#### Options Considered
1. **Simple Git-based**
   - Pros:
     - Minimal overhead
     - Standard git workflow
   - Cons:
     - Lacks explicit coordination
     - Higher risk of conflicts
     - Hard to track LLM context

2. **Comprehensive Documentation System**
   - Pros:
     - Clear coordination protocols
     - Good history tracking
     - Explicit state management
   - Cons:
     - More overhead
     - More files to maintain
     - More complex

3. **Issue-based System**
   - Pros:
     - Good task tracking
     - Standard GitHub feature
   - Cons:
     - Less structured
     - Harder to maintain context
     - More scattered information

#### Decision
**Chosen Option**: Comprehensive Documentation System

**Rationale**:
- Provides clear protocols for both LLMs and human
- Maintains good history while keeping current state clear
- Handles context limitations explicitly
- Worth the extra overhead for better coordination

#### Implementation
- STATUS.md for current state
- DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for history
- DECISIONS_LOG.md for major decisions
- INSTANCE_PROTOCOL.md for LLM coordination
- HUMAN_PROTOCOL.md for human coordination

#### Impact
- Sets standard for all future development
- Affects workflow for both human and LLMs
- Creates some overhead but should save time long-term
- Will need to be maintained consistently
