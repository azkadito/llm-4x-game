# Technical Architecture

## Core Design Principles

1. **Modularity First**
   - Keep systems loosely coupled
   - Enable easy testing and modification
   - Allow for future expansion

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Keep core game loop efficient
   - Optimize for large maps and many units
   - Careful resource management

3. **AI Integration**
   - Clean separation between game state and AI systems
   - Asynchronous LLM processing
   - Fallback systems for offline play

## System Architecture

### Core Game Loop
```
Game State

Rendering
```

### State Management
- Event-driven system for core game state
- Separate narrative state manager
- Asynchronous AI state processing

### Component Structure
```

## Technical Components

### Map System (Hex-based)
- Cube coordinate system for hex grid
- Chunk-based loading for large maps
- Efficient pathfinding implementation

### State Management
- Central state manager for game data
- Event system for updates
- Save/load functionality

### AI Integration
```
Game State → State Analyzer → LLM Request Queue → Response Processor → Event Generator
```

### Performance Targets
- Target framerate: 60 FPS
- Maximum map size: 200x200 hexes
- Support for 1000+ units
- Sub-100ms response time for basic actions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
```
/src
  /core           # Core game mechanics
    /state        # State management
    /map          # Map systems
    /units        # Unit management
  /ai             # AI systems
    /llm          # LLM integration
    /generation   # Content generation
  /ui             # User interface
  /utils          # Utilities
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for core logic
2. Integration tests for systems
3. Performance benchmarks
4. AI response quality metrics

### Development Workflow
1. Test-driven development
2. Regular performance profiling
3. Continuous integration
4. Regular refactoring
