   - Policy decisions
2. Action Phase
   - Unit movement
   - Combat resolution
   - Construction
3. Narrative Phase
   - Event processing
   - Story developments
   - Character interactions

### Time Scales
- Strategic: Empire-level decisions (turns)
- Tactical: Unit actions (within turns)
- Narrative: Story events (can span multiple turns)

## Interaction Systems

### Player Actions
- Direct control of units
- Resource management
- Diplomatic interactions
- Research directions
- Building/development
- Story choices

### Feedback Systems
